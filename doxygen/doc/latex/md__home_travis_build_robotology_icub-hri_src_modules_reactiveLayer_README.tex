This is the refactored version of the reactive layer as produced by U\+PF in 2015. \href{https://github.com/robotology/wysiwyd/tree/master/main/src/modules/reactiveLayerEFAA}{\tt The original version} led to several publications, and in particular\+:

\section*{How}

To launch the proactive demo (assuming that the standard modules are running -- O\+PC etc...), you have to launch these modules\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}ears
proactiveTagging
homeostasis
sensationManager
behaviorManager
allostaticController
\end{DoxyVerb}


We\textquotesingle{}ll provide soon a proper xml file to make it easier. For the time being it will launch the proactive demo as it was after B\+C\+BT. We are currently adding other drives and behaviors (looking at partner, naming known objects ...).

\section*{What}

The reactive layer resides for the time being in the {\ttfamily modules/interaction\+Engine} directory. We\textquotesingle{}ll move it soon to a {\ttfamily reactive\+Layer} one (which for the time being contains the E\+F\+AA version of it, that we will rename {\ttfamily reactive\+Layer\+E\+F\+AA}).

Anyway, it contains three subfolders\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily allostatic\+Controller}\+: a module dealing with the creation of drives and their connections to the modules below. Drives are configured in {\ttfamily app/allostatic\+Controller/conf}. It defines the dynamics of each drive (ranges, decay, etc...), which sensation modulates the dynamics (see {\ttfamily sensation\+Manager} below) as well as which behavior to trigger when the drive is under or over threshold (see {\ttfamily behavior\+Manager} below). Internally, the {\ttfamily allostatic\+Controller} module relies on the {\ttfamily homeostasis} one, which deals only with the drive dynamic and allows the drives to be continuously updated even when the {\ttfamily allostatic\+Controller} is waiting for a behavior to terminate (through R\+PC).
\item {\ttfamily behavior\+Manager}\+: a module containing a set of behaviors. It can receive R\+PC commands of the form {\ttfamily behavior\+\_\+name} which trigger the corresponding behavior (usually sent by the {\ttfamily allostatic\+Controller}). Each behavior is (actually, will be) responsible of the possible connections to other modules in order to gather the extra information it might need (e.\+g. an object name for pointing).
\item {\ttfamily sensation\+Manager}\+: a module containing a set of sensations, in the aim of modulating the dynamics in {\ttfamily allostatic\+Controller}. For example, in the context of the proactive demo, there is a sensation which is active when there are unknown objects in the scene and which is connected to the {\ttfamily tagging} drive.
